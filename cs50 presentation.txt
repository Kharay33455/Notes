I chose this project initially casue I was in a hurry and thought it'd be easeier to plan in my head. It wasn't. Obviously my design and planning skills could use some work. But in the end, I'm glad I chose it. I leanred a lot about the concepts of safe and working applications from working on this. Lots of ceoncepts and errors I made earlier on, some I could change and some I had to build around. I saw the important of designing and planning and most importantly organizing.

learned a lot of error handling

Next time, I would definitely try to keey all components and functions as separate to allow easier read of code and also allows you add new functionalities easier.

Learned to not only comment code but to be as descriptive with comments

should have used typescript

organize api functions from other functions
