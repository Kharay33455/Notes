// edit them and even silent them completely.

// A hook procedure is a function that is called to handle the event. It is a callback function

//Hooks slow down systems. Remove as soon as you can.

// A hook chain is a list of pointers to hook procedure functions. They pass a hook from start to end when it is triggered.
